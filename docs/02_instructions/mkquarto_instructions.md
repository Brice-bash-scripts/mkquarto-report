## 3. Bash Script Requirements
The bash script should be designed with the following specifications:
- Target OS: Linux / WSL
- Idempotency: The script should be able to run multiple times without causing issues or creating duplicate files unless explicitly forced.
- Directory Creation: The script should create all necessary directories if they do not already exist.
- File Generation: The script should generate all required files, including the main report.qmd, _quarto.yml, and references.bib, as well as the structured content files within the content folder.
- The script should not introduce any additional folders or files beyond what is specified in the project structure.
- The script should ensure compatibility with PDF rendering, avoiding any unsupported markdown features that could cause build failures.
- The script should include error handling to manage potential issues during execution, such as missing dependencies or permission errors.
- The script should provide clear output messages to indicate the progress of the project scaffolding process and any issues encountered.
- The script should be well-documented with comments explaining each step for maintainability and clarity.
- The script should be designed to be easily customizable for different project needs while adhering to the core structure and requirements outlined above.
- The script should be efficient and optimized for performance, minimizing unnecessary operations and ensuring a smooth user experience.
- The script should be compatible with common shell environments and should not rely on any non-standard utilities or features that may not be available in all environments.
- The script should include a help option to provide users with information on how to use it and what it does.
- The script should be tested to ensure it works as intended and does not produce any unintended side effects when run multiple times or in different environments.
- The script should be designed to be easily extendable in the future, allowing for additional features or modifications without requiring a complete rewrite.
- The script should not require any user input during execution, making it suitable for automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
- The script should be designed to be secure, avoiding any potential vulnerabilities or risks associated with file creation and execution.
- The script should be compatible with the latest versions of Quarto and any dependencies required for building the PDF output, ensuring that it remains functional as software updates are released.

## 4. Quarto Configuration (_quarto.yml)
The _quarto.yml file should be configured to support PDF output and include any necessary settings for the project. This may include specifying the output format, setting up references, and defining any custom styles or templates that should be used in the report. The configuration should be designed to ensure that the generated PDF is professional and adheres to the formatting standards outlined in the project requirements. The configuration should also be flexible enough to allow for future modifications or additions as needed, while maintaining compatibility with the overall project structure and requirements. The _quarto.yml file should be well-documented with comments explaining each setting and its purpose, making it easier for users to understand and modify as needed. The configuration should also be tested to ensure that it works correctly and produces the desired output when the report is built and rendered. The _quarto.yml file should be included in the project scaffolding process, ensuring that it is generated correctly and placed in the appropriate location within the project structure. The configuration should be designed to be easily maintainable and should follow best practices for Quarto configuration, ensuring that it remains functional and effective as the project evolves and as new features or requirements are added in the future.

- Example _quarto.yml configuration:
```yaml
project:
  output-dir: reports
  render:
    - report.qmd

bibliography: references.bib

format:
  html:
    toc: true
    number-sections: false
  pdf:
    documentclass: article
    top-level-division: section
    toc: false
    number-sections: false
    margin-left: 30mm
    margin-right: 30mm

execute:
  enabled: false
```

## 5. Preloaded QMD Templates (🔥 most important section)
The project should include preloaded .qmd templates for each section of the report, following the structure outlined in the project requirements. Each .qmd file should include a basic template with placeholder content that can be easily modified and expanded upon by the user. The templates should be designed to provide a clear starting point for each section of the report, with appropriate headings, subheadings, and formatting to ensure consistency throughout the document. The templates should also include any necessary metadata or front matter to ensure that they are properly recognized and rendered by Quarto when the report is built. The preloaded templates should be included in the project scaffolding process, ensuring that they are generated correctly and placed in the appropriate locations within the content folder structure. The templates should be designed to be easily customizable, allowing users to modify the content and structure as needed while maintaining the overall formatting and style of the report. The templates should also be tested to ensure that they work correctly and produce the desired output when rendered as part of the overall report. The inclusion of preloaded .qmd templates is a crucial aspect of this project, as it provides users with a solid foundation for creating professional technical reports with Quarto, while also saving time and effort in setting up the initial structure and formatting of the document. Each template should be designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of content, allowing users to easily create reports on a wide range of topics while maintaining a consistent and professional appearance throughout the document. The templates should also be designed to be easily extendable, allowing users to add additional sections or modify the existing structure as needed without requiring a complete overhaul of the project. The preloaded .qmd templates should be well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of each section and providing guidance on how to modify the content, making it easier for users to understand and utilize the templates effectively in their own projects.
